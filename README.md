# Pickle

Pickle is a simple drawing app built with python

that I made in two days :)

Use the tutorial or look through the code for controls. I'm not writing them here as well

## Icons

I got the viewer.exe and main.exe logos from Google Fonts and the logo for the tutorial (controls.exe) is a Unicode char.

## PKL Files

PKL are the files where Pickle stores images.

I used a python module called pickle to make this and I promise there is no connection. I was just thinking about how to store the images and I found that lib. Wow.
